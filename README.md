## Brief description:

The goal of our program is to control the train in Lab ECSS 3.217. The program has a GUI with buttons on it. Each button is a function to control the train.
Button (Ring the bell): a command is sent to the train to ring the bell
Button (Start the train): a command is sent to the train to start the train
Button (Accelerate the train): a command is sent to the train to accelerate
Button (Move the train): a command is sent to the train to move the train
Button (Decelerate the train): a command is sent to the train to decelerate the train
Button (Stop the train): a command is sent to the train to stop the train
## How this procedure differs from the development of a general purpose application:

The goal of this program is more specific than the general-purpose application. The program just focuses to control the train in Lab ECSS 3.217. It does not need to handle any other system. Therefore, the program does not have dynamic data structures or general functions.
