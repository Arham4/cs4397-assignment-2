Chris added a basic file structure for the project:
  Structs:
    Consists of shared structures for the program
  Controller:
    Coordinates the train and between files
    Has a scheduler and coordinates the tasks TBD
    I recommend we make a RM scheduler
  CmdIn:
    Takes command line input from python input and sends data to the controller
  SerialOut:
    Consists of functions to send serial commands to the train system

More comments are available in each respective file
More files can be added when needed
